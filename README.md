<p align="center">
Tool for browsing UnPatti's Ambonese - English dictionairy, creating custom practice lists, do tests etc.
This tool was created because I was unable to search from English to Ambonese and I wanted to be able to do so. 
After accomplishing this, I added features for assembling practice lists and quizzing yourself using these lists.
Most of the progress of this tool was lost months ago. This version is only able to save the contents of the dictionary to a .csv file. The other features will be added eventually.
